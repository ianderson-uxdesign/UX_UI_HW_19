                <p>From data culled via initial user research (quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews), Affinity Diagrams are made to indicate the essential concerns of a potential user. This persona is further explored through storyboarding and more acutely developed in User Journey mapping.</p>

                <p>With an established User Persona, interface design is initiated. Here, practical design (User Flows, etc.) is developed simultaneous to visual effect (Mood Boards, Style Guide, etc.). Once all aspects of a userâ€™s experience are considered, preliminary sketches are conducted before wireframing the initial prototype of the product. </p>

                <h3>iterative design</h3>
                <p>Once greenlit, prototypes are further developed while conducting user-testing. While ensuring initial research findings remain intact, the experiences observed inform the iterative design strategy. Once aims are confidently reached, conclusive case studies are prepared for stakeholder presentation. Iteration as needed is then conducted till product design is deemed satisfactory. </p>
